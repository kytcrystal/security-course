# What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. 
An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers. It ensures that transaction records are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. 

# Blockchain Security

Due to its cryptographic nature and decentralized structure, blockchain is highly secure and resistant to tampering and fraud. Consensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and all validated transactions are immutable because they are recorded permanently. No one, not even a system administrator, can delete a transaction.

In this project, I will explore how Blockchain technology is able to provide a secure method for recording and verifying transactions.

## Basic Blockchain Security

Blockchain security is a comprehensive risk management system for a blockchain network.

Blockchain technology is based on principles of cryptography, decentralization and consensus, which ensure trust in transactions. The data is structured into blocks and each block contains a transaction or bundle of transactions.

Each new block connects to all the blocks before it in a cryptographic chain in a way that it's nearly impossible to tamper with. All transactions within the blocks are validated and agreed upon by a consensus mechanism, ensuring that each transaction is true and correct.

Blockchain technology enables decentralization through the participation of members across a distributed network. There is no single point of failure and a single user cannot change the record of transactions.
